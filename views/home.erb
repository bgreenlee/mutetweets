<p>Mute Tweets allows you to temporarily unfollow someone who's being too noisy, refollowing them after a given period of time.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To mute someone, just tweet:</p>
  
<p><code>
@mutetweets <em>&lt;@noisyperson&gt; &lt;length of time&gt;</em> 
</code><p>
  
<p><em><code>&lt;length of time&gt;</code></em> follows the format <em><code>&lt;number&gt;&lt;unit&gt;</code></em>, where <em><code>&lt;unit&gt;</code></em> is one of "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), or "d" (days).</p>

<p>Note: If you haven't used Mute Tweets yet, you'll get an @-message from @mutetweets with a link to this page. Just click on the link in the upper right corner to connect Mute Tweets to your Twitter account so that it can unfollow and refollow on your behalf. Don't worry--it won't ever do anything else to your Twitter account, and you can revoke access any time.</p>
